	  <p>You are very aware of the world around you, and you may notice more things than other people seem to. You tend to tune into many different sights, smells, sounds, and feelings at once. You may feel overwhelmed by very loud or crowded places. Busy places may seem to bother you more than the average person. You may avoid activities and interactions that are more “intense” in order to feel calm. You feel best in peaceful and quiet settings. </p>

	  <h3>Neutral (Caregiver)</h3>
	  <p>If you have neutral sensory needs, you may notice what is around you in a way that is similar to other people. You aren’t bothered by loud noises, bright lights, strong flavors or smells. You do not usually get motion sickness.  You are comfortable when you sit in a quiet room with typical lighting, and you don’t need to make changes to feel more alert or excited. You feel just as comfortable in a busy room as you do in a calm, quiet one. You can usually focus on people when they talk to you, and keep track of projects or tasks no matter where you are, and no matter if that place is busy or calm.</p>
	  <h5><strong>You may find many of the following statements to be true if you generally have a neutral sensory responsivity:</strong></h5>
	  <ul>
	    <li>It is not a problem to read a book while sitting at a table in a busy coffee shop</li>
	    <li>You feel at ease waiting in line at the grocery store</li>
	    <li>You do not feel anxious or upset by bright lights or loud sounds</li>
	    <li>You do not feel overly bored or unable to pay attention when in dimmer lighting or with quieter sounds</li>
	    <li>While riding in the car, passing through sharp turns or going up and down steep hills does not scare or disturb you</li>
	    <li>You do not feel bothered by strong flavors or aromas</li>
	    <li>You can enjoy food and smells, even if they are a little bland</li>
	    <li>You don’t mind typical forms of physical contact, like hugs, kisses and high-fives from people you are comfortable with</li>

	  <h3>Underreactive (Caregiver)</h3>
	  <p>If you have low responsivity you may not notice things as much as other people seem to. You might enjoy activities and situations that are more “intense” in order to get more sensory input. When you seek more “intense” experiences, you may feel more balanced in your life. You aren’t bothered by sights, smells, sounds, and feelings around you. It may even be challenging to notice new things around you. You like places that are loud, bright, fast-moving, or exciting.</p>

	  <h3>Relationship summary and suggested activites:</h3>
	  <div class="output output-over-over">
	    <p>Overall, you and your child are both particularly aware of your surrounding worlds. Sights, smells and sounds are frequently jarring and create distractions that interrupt a conversation, duties at work or social outings. It may be difficult for you to manage competing sources of distraction when you are tasked with typical household maintenance activities like laundry, cleaning or grocery shopping as varied sights, sounds and busy environments are disorienting and dysregulating. By consequence, you might prefer quieter, calmer environments that do not strain your senses in so many ways. Your child displays similar tendencies, and reacts strongly to noises, lights, smells and tastes. Your child is much more likely to behave well in a restful setting with minimal noises, muted lighting and few distractions.</p>
	      <p>If you identify with this description, please see the suggested activities and information on the next page and try them out with your child. We hope that through activities and environments that meet both of your sensory needs, it will be easier to focus on bonding and shared enjoyment in your daily life.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div class="output output-over-under">
	    <p>Overall, you are much more sensitive to the sights, smells, feelings, and sensations in the world than your child is. You may prefer quiet and calm environments, while your child may prefer lots of excitement like bright lights, loud sounds, and big movements. Places and activities that your child enjoys may be too stimulating or unenjoyable for you. Your child may also seem bored or appear to have a hard time calming down during activities that you pick out.</p>

	  <div class="output output-under-over">
	    <p>Overall, your child is much more sensitive to the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings in the world than you are. In fact, you may find that you are less sensitive to the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings in the world than many people that you know.  This means that situations that you feel comfortable with in daily life may be extremely intense or upsetting for your child. While you may enjoy going to the grocery store at busier times of the day, your child may struggle with the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings of the grocery store at even the slowest times of the day.  You may find festivals or crowded places to be very fun, but your child may struggle with the stimulation in small groups of people. This contrast between your feelings and responses and your child’s may cause you to feel frustrated that your child does not enjoy the things that you do and it may seem to you that your child overreacts to situations that you find normal or fun. This may also mean that you avoid events, activities, or interactions that you or your child find enjoyable. For you, this may mean you can’t take your child to parties or sporting events; for your child, this may mean that you don’t enjoy the quiet, calming activities that they do.</p>

	  </div>

	  <div class="output output-under-under">
	    <p>Overall, you and your child seem to be similarly unaware of the surrounding environment. You see that your child has a difficult time registering announcements at school, cues to transition  between activities during school clubs or sports teams and performs much more successfully when strong, obvious signals are provided via loud bells, flashing lights or post-it notes. You can “see yourself” in your child, and recall similar challenges in your own childhood. Similarities likely occur in a shared love of highly stimulating, exciting settings and events - amusement parks, a crowded beach on a sunny day, or shopping in a busy store around the holidays. You both tend to prefer clothing, blankets or toys with interesting or appealing textures, tend to play music or the TV at high volumes, and enjoy spicier foods at home or in restaurants. Diverse environmental stimuli are extremely appealing, contribute to better performances at work and school, and provide you both with amusement and and ongoing source of connection to your outer world.</p>

	    <p>Overall, your child is much more sensitive to the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings in the world than you are. Situations that you feel comfortable in during daily life like going to the grocery store or a dinner party may be too intense or unenjoyable for your child. You may shy away from going certain places or trying certain activities because they would make your child feel upset or uneasy.</p>

	    <p>Overall, your child is much less sensitive to the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings in the world than you are. Situations that you feel comfortable with in daily life, like going to the grocery store or a dinner party, may end up becoming much more of an ordeal than you expect. Your child may knock things off the shelf at the grocery store, for example, or be louder or play more roughly with others than is appropriate at a party. You may end up avoiding activities, events, or errands because you worry about how your child might act. When it comes to things that most people seem sensitive too, it may seem like your child doesn’t even notice anything is wrong. Loud sirens might not bother them, or they may want to touch you and other things all the time. You may worry for their safety as they navigate the world, or their social interactions.</p>

		<li>Minimizing Screen Time for You and Your Child 1. Clean up your device: mindfully look at the apps on your device and decide which of those apps could be uninstalled. Ask yourself: how much of my (my child's) time is this app taking? Does this app make me happier? How does this app add to my life? 2. Organize: create file folders on your device and organize your apps. Possible folder ideas include ""Brain Food,"" ""Leisure,"" ""Junk Food,"" etc. When you put the apps into folders they are't as visible when you open your device and they aren't as tempting either. 3. Set limits: be realistic and set time limits for using your device. How much time do you actually need to use it (for work? for school? for contacting loved ones?)? How much time is the device being used as a time filler? When you set these limits, do so with your child. Make it a social contract, you are in this together. 4. Stick to those limits: be disciplined, with your child and with yourself. 5. Set a realistic goal: start out by trying to stick to your limits for a week. After the week is up, take a few minutes to talk about how it felt, what worked, and what could be improved. 6. Keep a log: make a note at the end of each day about how you felt that day and about how your child felt. Once you have accomplished your first goal, look back over that log and see if you notice any changes that have occured.		</li>

Families can work together to create screen-free environments to better prepare for a night's rest, and eliminate possible sources of distraction, stimulation and stress 1. Remove screens from the bedroom prior to bed 2. Encourage reading or meditation (quiet activities) at least 20 minutes before attempting to sleep. 3. Establish a consistent bedtime time of day, along with bedtime preparation routine to follow each night - this includes when you or your child showers/bathes, when teeth are brushed, when you stop eating for the night, when the TV goes off, when the bedtime stories/songs emerge"	</li>

		<li>Communicating about Contact	Advance notification of intention to have contact - AND - let the child direct their own physial interactions/needs. Parent should tell child in advance that they are approaching and that they intend to touch them/have contact with them (avoid surprising them). Try saying things like "I need to wash your hair. I'm going to drizzle water on your head first." - AND - "you have a smudge on your chin, why don't you try wiping it with a washcloth?"		</li>
