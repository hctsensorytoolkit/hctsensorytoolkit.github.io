	  <h3>Overreactive (Caregiver)</h3>
	  <p>You are very aware of the world around you, and you may notice more things than other people seem to. You tend to tune into many different sights, smells, sounds, and feelings at once. You may feel overwhelmed by very loud or crowded places. Busy places may seem to bother you more than the average person. You may avoid activities and interactions that are more “intense” in order to feel calm. You feel best in peaceful and quiet settings. </p>

	  <h3>Underreactive (Caregiver)</h3>
	  <p>If you have low responsivity you may not notice things as much as other people seem to. You might enjoy activities and situations that are more “intense” in order to get more sensory input. When you seek more “intense” experiences, you may feel more balanced in your life. You aren’t bothered by sights, smells, sounds, and feelings around you. It may even be challenging to notice new things around you. You like places that are loud, bright, fast-moving, or exciting.

	  <h3>Neutral (Caregiver)</h3>
	  <p>If you have neutral sensory needs, you may notice what is around you in a way that is similar to other people. You aren’t bothered by loud noises, bright lights, strong flavors or smells. You do not usually get motion sickness.  You are comfortable when you sit in a quiet room with typical lighting, and you don’t need to make changes to feel more alert or excited. You feel just as comfortable in a busy room as you do in a calm, quiet one. You can usually focus on people when they talk to you, and keep track of projects or tasks no matter where you are, and no matter if that place is busy or calm.</p>

	  <h3>Overreactive (Child)</h3>
	  <p>Your child is very aware of the world around them, and they may notice more things around them than other people seem to. They tend to tune into many different sights, smells, sounds, and feelings at once. They may seem overwhelmed by very loud or crowded places. Busy places may seem to bother your child more than they do other children. They may avoid activities and interactions that are more “intense” in order to feel calm. They behave best and seem happiest in peaceful and quiet settings.
