	  <h2>About the Toolkit</h2>
	  <h3>Purpose:</h3>
	  <p>
	    This tool draws on existing sensory integration theory and the clinical expertise of current practitioners in this field.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Its aim is to normalize the spectrum of sensory preferences in everyday life. We hope that you will explore the many relationship pairings that may reflect the interaction between you and your child and make use of the resources suggested in a way that best fits your family.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We understand that relationships are complicated, and that you may see bits and pieces of yourself and your child in different sensory type descriptions. We hope that you will look for the predominant patterns in identifying your sensory types and spend some time exploring different combinations and activities.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Development:</h3>
	  <p>
	    In Summer 2016, Harbor Children’s Therapy submitted a project proposal to the University of Washington’s Master of Occupational Therapy Program. This proposal requested student involvement in the design of a resource for families with children receiving services for sensory processing challenges. The tool would function by exploring the sensory preferences of caregivers and their children to provide focused activity and environmental suggestions with the ultimate objective of normalizing sensory preferences in daily life.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    
	    UW students Annie Brandjord, Lauren Eykholt and Hilary Figgs, faculty supervisor Dr. Janet Powell, and website developer Grant Butler, partnered with HCT to design and develop this specialized toolkit. The students gathered information through a scoping review of current research in the field of sensory processing, as well as a needs assessment drawing on input from HCT staff, clinic families, and observations from leaders in the field. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The tool was launched in beta testing in April 2017 with a small group of parents and caregivers at the HCT clinic in Gig Harbor, WA. Their experiences and feedback were vital in the completion of this tool.
