	  <h2>Relationship summary and suggested activites:</h2>
	  
	  <p>Overall, you and your child are both particularly aware of your surrounding worlds. Sights, smells and sounds are frequently jarring and create distractions that interrupt a conversation, duties at work or social outings. It may be difficult for you to manage competing sources of distraction when you are tasked with typical household maintenance activities like laundry, cleaning or grocery shopping as varied sights, sounds and busy environments are disorienting and dysregulating. By consequence, you might prefer quieter, calmer environments 1that do not strain your senses in so many ways. Your child displays similar tendencies, and reacts strongly to noises, lights, smells and tastes. Your child is much more likely to behave well in a restful setting with minimal noises, muted lighting and few distractions.</p>

If your child underreacts to touch, they may not be as aware of pain as you might expect. Even injuries that may appear small/minor (bumped head, low-level burn or scratch) should receive thorough attention and discussion to reduce the risk of them happening again. </p>

    <p class="link-desc">1. Clean up your device: mindfully look at the apps on your device and decide which of those apps could be uninstalled. Ask yourself: how much of my (my child's) time is this app taking? Does this app make me happier? How does this app add to my life?
2. Organize: Create file folders on your device and organize your apps. Possible folder ideas include "Brain Food," "Leisure," "Junk Food," etc. When you put the apps into folders they are't as visible when you open your device and they aren't as tempting either
3. Set limits: Be realistic and set time limits for using your device. How much time do you actually need to use it (for work? for school? for contacting loved ones?)? How much time is the device being used as a time filler? When you set these limits, do so with your child. Make it a social contract, you are in this together
4. Stick to those limits: Be disciplined, with your child and with yourself
5. Set a realistic goal: Start out by trying to stick to your limits for a week. After the week is up, take a few minutes to talk about how it felt, what worked, and what could be improved
6. Keep a log: Make a note at the end of each day about how you felt that day and about how your child felt. Once you have accomplished your first goal, look back over that log and see if you notice any changes that have occured</p>

1. Remove screens from the bedroom prior to bed
2. Encourage reading or meditation (quiet activities) at least 20 minutes before attempting to sleep
3. Establish a consistent bedtime time of day, along with bedtime preparation routine to follow each night - this includes when you or your child showers/bathes, when teeth are brushed, when you stop eating for the night, when the TV goes off, when the bedtime stories/songs emerge</p>
