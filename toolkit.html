	  <h2>Relationship summary and suggested activites:</h2>
	  <div class="output output-over-over">
	    <p>Overall, you and your child are both particularly aware of your surrounding worlds. Sights, smells and sounds are frequently jarring and create distractions that interrupt a conversation, duties at work or social outings. It may be difficult for you to manage competing sources of distraction when you are tasked with typical household maintenance activities like laundry, cleaning or grocery shopping as varied sights, sounds and busy environments are disorienting and dysregulating. By consequence, you might prefer quieter, calmer environments that do not strain your senses in so many ways. Your child displays similar tendencies, and reacts strongly to noises, lights, smells and tastes. Your child is much more likely to behave well in a restful setting with minimal noises, muted lighting and few distractions.</p>
	      <p>If you identify with this description, please see the suggested activities and information on the next page and try them out with your child. We hope that through activities and environments that meet both of your sensory needs, it will be easier to focus on bonding and shared enjoyment in your daily life.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div class="output output-over-under">
	    <p>Overall, you are much more sensitive to the sights, smells, feelings, and sensations in the world than your child is. You may prefer quiet and calm environments, while your child may prefer lots of excitement like bright lights, loud sounds, and big movements. Places and activities that your child enjoys may be too stimulating or unenjoyable for you. Your child may also seem bored or appear to have a hard time calming down during activities that you pick out.</p>

	  <div class="output output-under-over">
	    <p>Overall, your child is much more sensitive to the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings in the world than you are. In fact, you may find that you are less sensitive to the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings in the world than many people that you know.  This means that situations that you feel comfortable with in daily life may be extremely intense or upsetting for your child. While you may enjoy going to the grocery store at busier times of the day, your child may struggle with the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings of the grocery store at even the slowest times of the day.  You may find festivals or crowded places to be very fun, but your child may struggle with the stimulation in small groups of people. This contrast between your feelings and responses and your child’s may cause you to feel frustrated that your child does not enjoy the things that you do and it may seem to you that your child overreacts to situations that you find normal or fun. This may also mean that you avoid events, activities, or interactions that you or your child find enjoyable. For you, this may mean you can’t take your child to parties or sporting events; for your child, this may mean that you don’t enjoy the quiet, calming activities that they do.</p>

	  <div class="output output-under-under">
	    <p>Overall, you and your child seem to be similarly unaware of the surrounding environment. You see that your child has a difficult time registering announcements at school, cues to transition  between activities during school clubs or sports teams and performs much more successfully when strong, obvious signals are provided via loud bells, flashing lights or post-it notes. You can “see yourself” in your child, and recall similar challenges in your own childhood. Similarities likely occur in a shared love of highly stimulating, exciting settings and events - amusement parks, a crowded beach on a sunny day, or shopping in a busy store around the holidays. You both tend to prefer clothing, blankets or toys with interesting or appealing textures, tend to play music or the TV at high volumes, and enjoy spicier foods at home or in restaurants. Diverse environmental stimuli are extremely appealing, contribute to better performances at work and school, and provide you both with amusement and and ongoing source of connection to your outer world.</p>

	    <p>Overall, your child is much less sensitive to the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings in the world than you are. Situations that you feel comfortable with in daily life, like going to the grocery store or a dinner party, may end up becoming much more of an ordeal than you expect. Your child may knock things off the shelf at the grocery store, for example, or be louder or play more roughly with others than is appropriate at a party. You may end up avoiding activities, events, or errands because you worry about how your child might act. When it comes to things that most people seem sensitive too, it may seem like your child doesn’t even notice anything is wrong. Loud sirens might not bother them, or they may want to touch you and other things all the time. You may worry for their safety as they navigate the world, or their social interactions.</p>
