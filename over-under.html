	  <h2>Relationship Summary and suggested activities:</h2>
	  <p>Overall, you are much more sensitive to the sights, smells, feelings, and sensations in the world than your child is. You may prefer quiet and calm environments, while your child may prefer lots of excitement like bright lights, loud sounds, and big movements. Places and activities that your child enjoys may be too stimulating or unenjoyable for you. Your child may also seem bored or appear to have a hard time calming down during activities that you pick out.</p>

If your child under reacts to touch, they may not be as aware of pain as you might expect. Even injuries that may appear small/minor (bumped head, low-level burn or scratch) should receive thorough attention and discussion to reduce the risk of them happening again. </p>

    <p class="link-desc">1. Clean up your device: mindfully look at the apps on your device and decide which of those apps could be uninstalled. Ask yourself: how much of my (my child's) time is this app taking? Does this app make me happier? How does this app add to my life?
2. Organize: Create file folders on your device and organize your apps. Possible folder ideas include "Brain Food," "Leisure," "Junk Food," etc. When you put the apps into folders they aren't as visible when you open your device and they aren't as tempting either
3. Set limits: Be realistic and set time limits for using your device. How much time do you actually need to use it (for work? for school? for contacting loved ones?)? How much time is the device being used as a time filler? When you set these limits, do so with your child. Make it a social contract, you are in this together
4. Stick to those limits: Be disciplined, with your child and with yourself
5. Set a realistic goal: Start out by trying to stick to your limits for a week. After the week is up, take a few minutes to talk about how it felt, what worked, and what could be improved
6. Keep a log: Make a note at the end of each day about how you felt that day and about how your child felt. Once you have accomplished your first goal, look back over that log and see if you notice any changes that have occurred</p>

    <p class="link-desc">If you or your child are not comfortable with typical physical contact (or are easily overstimulated/bothered by contact), try modeling appropriate ways to set limits.

If your child under reacts to touch, they may not be as aware of pain as you might expect. Even injuries that may appear small/minor (bumped head, low-level burn or scratch) should receive thorough attention and discussion to reduce the risk of them happening again. </p>
