	  <p>Overall, you and your child seem to be similarly unaware of the surrounding environment. You see that your child has a difficult time registering announcements at school, cues to transition  between activities during school clubs or sports teams and performs much more successfully when strong, obvious signals are provided via loud bells, flashing lights or post-it notes. You can “see yourself" in your child, and recall similar challenges in your own childhood. Similarities likely occur in a shared love of highly stimulating, exciting settings and events - amusement parks, a crowded beach on a sunny day, or shopping in a busy store around the holidays. You both tend to prefer clothing, blankets or toys with interesting or appealing textures, tend to play music or the TV at high volumes, and enjoy spicier foods at home or in restaurants. Diverse environmental stimuli are extremely appealing, contribute to better performances at work and school, and provide you both with amusement and and ongoing source of connection to your outer world.</p>

    Parental Education on Safety Risks when Children have Low Touch Responsivity
    <p class="link-desc">Be aware if you have lower levels of sensitivity to tactile input and notice if you are modeling this type of reaction to your child. Ex: Parents might model safe use of an iron, time spent around stove, what to do when there's a scraped knee or bumped head, etc.

If your child underreacts to touch, they may not be as aware of pain as you might expect. Even injuries that may appear small/minor (bumped head, low-level burn or scratch) should receive thorough attention and discussion to reduce the risk of them happening again. </p>

   Minimizing Screen Time for You and Your Child
   <ol>
      <li>Clean up your device: mindfully look at the apps on your device and decide which of those apps could be uninstalled. Ask yourself: how much of my (my child's) time is this app taking? Does this app make me happier? How does this app add to my life?</li>
      <li>Organize: Create file folders on your device and organize your apps. Possible folder ideas include "Brain Food," "Leisure," "Junk Food," etc. When you put the apps into folders they are't as visible when you open your device and they aren't as tempting either</li>
      <li>Set limits: Be realistic and set time limits for using your device. How much time do you actually need to use it (for work? for school? for contacting loved ones?)? How much time is the device being used as a time filler? When you set these limits, do so with your child. Make it a social contract, you are in this together</li>
      <li>Stick to those limits: Be disciplined, with your child and with yourself</li>
      <li>Set a realistic goal: Start out by trying to stick to your limits for a week. After the week is up, take a few minutes to talk about how it felt, what worked, and what could be improved</li>
      <li>Keep a log: Make a note at the end of each day about how you felt that day and about how your child felt. Once you have accomplished your first goal, look back over that log and see if you notice any changes that have occured</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="link-desc">Current studies find that limiting screen time before bed improves quality and duration of sleep. Families can work together to create screen-free environments to better prepare for a night's rest, and eliminate possible sources of distraction, stimulation and stress

1. Remove screens from the bedroom prior to bed
2. Encourage reading or meditation (quiet activities) at least 20 minutes before attempting to sleep
3. Establish a consistent bedtime time of day, along with bedtime preparation routine to follow each night - this includes when you or your child showers/bathes, when teeth are brushed, when you stop eating for the night, when the TV goes off, when the bedtime stories/songs emerge</p>

    Communicating about Contact
    <p class="link-desc">Provide advance notification of intention to have contact with your child - AND - let them direct their own physial interactions/needs. Tell your child in advance that you intend to touch them/have contact with them (avoid surprising them). Try saying things like "I need to wash your hair. I'm going to drizzle water on your head first." - AND - "you have a smudge on your chin, why don't you try wiping it with a washcloth?"</p>

    <p class="link-desc">If you or your child are not comfortable with typical physical contact (or are easliy overstimulated/bothered by contact), try modeling appropriate ways to set limits.

Ex: "I'm not a big fan of kisses or hugs, but I'm so excited to see Grandma!" </p>
  </li>
 <li>
    Parental Education on Safety Risks when Children have Low Touch Responsivity
    <p class="link-desc">Be aware if you have lower levels of sensitivity to tactile input and notice if you are modeling this type of reaction to your child- ex - model safe use of an iron, time spent around stove, what to do when there's a scraped knee or bumped head, etc.

If your child underreacts to touch, they may not be as aware of pain as you might expect. Even injuries that may appear small/minor (bumped head, low-level burn or scratch) should receive thorough attention and discussion to reduce the risk of them happening again. </p>
