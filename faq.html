	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      </div>

      <h3>What is sensory integration?  What is sensory integration dysfunction?  What are possible causes?</h3>
      <p>This answer was taken directly from <a href="http://hctherapy.com/faq.html">Harbor Children’s Therapy FAQ.</a></p> 

      <p>Sensory integration is a term that refers to the way the nervous system receives messages from the body’s basic sensory systems and turns them into appropriate motor and behavioral responses. The normal process of sensory integration begins before birth and continues through life.  Sensory integration is necessary for almost every activity that we perform because the combination of multiple sensory inputs is essential for us to understand and interact with our surroundings.  Sensory integration (SI) is a theory that was first pioneered by A. Jean Ayres, Ph.D., OTR in the 1960’s.  Ayres’ initial work on the SI theory instigated ongoing research that looked at the crucial foundation that SI provides for complex learning and behavior throughout life.</p>

      <p>Sensory Integration Dysfunction (SID) is a neurological disorder that results from the brain’s inability to integrate information received from body sensations (sight, sounds, smell, tastes, temperatures, and the position and movements of the body).  It is a condition that exists when sensory signals don't get organized into appropriate responses. Ayres likened this disorder to a neurological "traffic jam" that prevents certain parts of the brain from receiving the information needed to interpret sensory information correctly. It is therefore difficult to process and act upon information received through the senses, which creates challenges in performing countless everyday tasks. Motor clumsiness, behavioral problems, anxiety, depression, school failure, and other impacts may result if the disorder is not treated effectively.</p>
      
      <p>Factors that contribute to sensory integration dysfunction include:  premature birth, autism, learning disabilities, maternal substance abuse, stress-related disorders, brain injury and attention-deficit disorder.  The two largest contributing conditions are autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders. </p>

      <h3>Where can I go to learn more about sensory processing? </h3>

      <p>We recommend the resources provided on <a href="http://hctherapy.com/resources.html">Harbor Children’s Therapy website.</a></p>

      <h3>I have a question that is not addressed in FAQ</h3>

      <p>If you have a question about the use of this tool or a comment about this tool, please <a href="contact.html">contact us.</a> If you are seeking medical advice or have concerns about sensory processing, seek advice from a licensed healthcare professional.</p>

      <h3>Some of these suggestions and information conflict with advice I’ve gotten from a healthcare provider, or other information I’ve read. </h3>

      <p>This tool was created as an informal informational resource only. We recommend that you use your own judgment in trying activities that seem like a good match for you and your child. This tool is not intended to replace advice from a healthcare provider. Always consult with your licensed healthcare provider and an occupational therapist who has expertise in sensory integration as your primary guide. There are many ways to classify sensory preferences, and this tool is not the only way to categorize sensory preferences.</p>

      <p>This tool is intended to explore sensory preferences and relationships. This is a largely unexplored topic, and we encourage critical thinking and feedback about all of the information provided. If you have questions about trying some of these activities, consult your licensed healthcare provider. Additionally, if you have feedback or concerns about this tool please <a href="contact.html">let us know.</a></p>

      <h3>I don’t feel like these types are an accurate description of my relationship with my child. What are my options?</h3>

      <p>First, we recommend that you read all of the descriptions available to see if you can find a pair that feels like a more accurate match. The tool is based on the philosophy that we all experience sensory preferences existing along a spectrum, which can change from day to day. Additionally, you may identify with aspects of multiple categories (for example, some people may love loud music but dislike playing with messy materials). We encourage you to explore this resource broadly and use your judgement to pull out activities and suggestions that are a good fit for your circumstances. We encourage you to mix and match suggestions as best fits your needs.</p>

      <p>There are many ways to classify sensory preferences. This is not the only way to categorize sensory preferences. This tool is simply meant to provide information about sensory preferences and how having different sensory styles can impact a relationship. All relationships are complex, and sensory preferences only capture one of the many factors that can impact a relationship.</p>
